# Firmware for CAEN V2495 General Purpose Module

A.Elykov (AlexElykov@yahoo.com)

## Description:
Custom firmware for the UFPGA on the CAEN V2495 general purpose board


## Prerequisites:
	- Altera Quartus II 13.0sp1 (web/full edition) or higher
	- Cyclone V FPGA has to be supported. 
	- Note: to be able to compile this on the free web version, might need to disable the SignalTap logic analyser in Assignments - Settings - SignalTap II

## Architecture: 
This is a generic busy firmware for the module and it can be easily expanded for other usages.
	* Main changes from the V1495 firmware
		- Use of VHDL native libraries
		- The firmware is less bloated, uses separate entities not components
		- User defined registers implemented in the V2495_pkg not in the HAL
		- Does not have the XENON1T/nT High Energy Veto or Veto_TRG support
